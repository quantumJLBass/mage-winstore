mage-winstore
=============
This is a simple app

The goal is to do a few simple things.  One controll an order.
Something else it should do ia simple edits.


It should also allow for custom parts that are for utilities and what not.  Hooked in by choice to extend this.


This will have to have an extension to pair with this app.  That extension wil also extend the rest API.  We want to trigger things like a clean up or, turn on/off a sale


Should also allow for taking pictures and then uploadeding the file.  a local photo editor would be good too

Also this should have local storage.
